## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-29

### Added
- Invisible persistent wiki memory: `WikiMemoryService` owns retrieval, validation, atomic mutation, git commit, and qmd refresh.
- Read tools `wiki_search` and `wiki_read` exposed to the Pydantic AI main agent and to the FastMCP server.
- `MemoryEnricher` sub-agent proposes a structured `MemoryPlan` from a bounded evidence envelope (user request, assistant answer, pages read, citations, current page metadata, active schema).
- Per-wiki Harness Memory namespace derived from `WikiIdentity` so two wikis against the same install do not share state.
- CLI default for free-form REPL commands routes through `Orchestrator.run_with_memory`; `--no-memory` preserves plain `Orchestrator.run`.
- FastMCP `wiki_search`, `wiki_read`, and expanded `query` response with `citations`, `pages_read`, and `changed_pages`.

### Changed
- `capabilities.memory` now requires a `wiki_root` argument (was optional).

### Fixed
- `WikiMemoryService.apply_plan` now passes an explicit `files=[...]` to `atomic_commit` so newly created pages and `wiki/log.md` lines are committed (was using `git add -u`, which dropped untracked files).
- Failure path now snapshots and restores the dirty tree on commit failure (was leaving partial writes behind).
- `hash_page` distinguishes missing file (returns `""`) from empty file (returns SHA-256 of empty string).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-27

### Added
- Initial release: Karpathy-pattern LLM wiki with `pydantic-ai`-harness agent, FastMCP server, and CLI (init / ingest / query / lint / REPL).
